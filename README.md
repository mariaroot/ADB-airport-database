# ADB airport database

I built a system that airport staff could use to issue tickets to passengers who had previously reserved flights. I created a database with 8 tables. Once all the SQL code had run, there were at least 7 rows of data in each table. 
I used this example data to test the various functions, stored procedures, triggers and views that I'd written. These database objects automated processes, maintaining data integrity and concurrency while making these processes quicker for airport staff.
